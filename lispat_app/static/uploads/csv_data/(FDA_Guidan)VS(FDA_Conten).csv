Guidance for Industry
Cybersecurity for Networked Medical Devices Containing Off-the-Shelf (OTS) Software
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.
Introduction
A growing number of medical devices are designed to be connected to computer networks. Many of these networked medical devices incorporate off-the-shelf software that is vulnerable to cybersecurity threats such as viruses and worms. These vulnerabilities may represent a risk to the safe and effective operation of networked medical devices and typically require an ongoing maintenance effort throughout the product life cycle to assure an adequate degree of protection. FDA is issuing this guidance to clarify how existing regulations, including the Quality System (QS) Regulation, apply to such cybersecurity maintenance activities.
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.
The Least Burdensome Approach
We believe we should consider the least burdensome approach in all areas of medical device regulation. This guidance reflects our careful review of the relevant scientific and legal requirements and what we believe is the least burdensome way for you to comply with those

requirements. However, if you believe that an alternative approach would be less burdensome, please contact us so we can consider your point of view. You may send your written comments to the contact persons listed on the coversheet to this guidance or to the CDRH Ombudsman. Comprehensive information on CDRH's Ombudsman, including ways to contact him, can be found on the Internet at .
Background
This guidance outlines general principles that we consider to be applicable to software maintenance actions required to address cybersecurity vulnerabilities for networked medical devices—specifically, those that incorporate off-the-shelf (OTS) software. The guidance is organized in question-and-answer format, providing responses to questions that have frequently been posed to FDA staff. The “I” in the questions and the “you” in the answers are intended to apply to device manufacturers who incorporate OTS software in their medical devices.
The QS regulation, 21 CFR Part 820, applies to software maintenance actions. In addition,
FDA has issued several guidance documents on software, including:
General Principles of Software Validation; Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, January 11, 2002, .
Guidance for Industry, FDA Reviewers and Compliance on Off-the-Shelf Software Use in Medical Devices, September 9, 1999,

Questions and Answers
1.  Which medical devices are covered by this guidance?
This guidance provides recommendations for medical devices that incorporate off-the-shelf (OTS) software and that can be connected to a private intranet or the public Internet. This guidance is addressed to device manufacturers who incorporate OTS software in their medical devices. However, this information also may be useful to network administrators in health care organizations and information technology vendors.
2.  What is a cybersecurity vulnerability?
For purposes of this guidance, a cybersecurity vulnerability exists whenever the OTS software provides the opportunity for unauthorized access to the network or the medical device. Cybersecurity vulnerabilities open the door to unwanted software changes that may have an effect on the safety and effectiveness of the medical device.
What is it about “network-connected medical devices” that causes so much concern?
Vulnerabilities in cybersecurity may represent a risk to the safe and effective operation of networked medical devices using OTS software. Failure to properly address these vulnerabilities could result in an adverse effect on public health. A major concern with OTS software is the need for timely software patches to correct newly discovered vulnerabilities in the software.
Who is responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of medical devices that incorporate OTS software?
You (the device manufacturer who uses OTS software in your medical device) bear the responsibility for the continued safe and effective performance of the medical device, including the performance of OTS software that is part of the device.1
How should purchasers and users of these medical devices respond to information about a cybersecurity vulnerability?
FDA recommends that purchasers and users of medical devices that may be subject to a cybersecurity vulnerability contact you with their concerns. As Question 4 explains, you are responsible for the performance of OTS software that is part of your device. Although there may be times when it is appropriate for the user to become involved (see Question 9 below), the user should not attempt to make changes without seeking your advice and recommendations.
For more information, you should refer to “Guidance for Industry, FDA Reviewers and Compliance on Off-The-Shelf Software Use in Medical Devices,” Sept. 9, 1999 (see Background section of this guidance).

What regulations apply to software patches that address cybersecurity vulnerabilities?
The need to be vigilant and responsive to cybersecurity vulnerabilities is part of your obligation under 21 CFR 820.100 to systematically analyze sources of information and implement actions needed to correct and prevent problems. The preamble to the QS regulation explains that actions taken should “be appropriate to the magnitude of the problem and commensurate with the risks encountered” (61 Fed. Reg. 52633; Oct. 7, 1996). Information in this guidance will remind you of some of the actions that ordinarily will be necessary to address this particular type of software concern.
Under 21 CFR 820.30(g), design validation requires that devices conform to defined user needs and intended uses, including an obligation to perform software validation and risk analysis, where appropriate. Software changes to address cybersecurity vulnerabilities are design changes and must be validated before approval and issuance. 21 CFR 820.30(i).
Is FDA premarket review required prior to implementation of a software patch to address a cybersecurity vulnerability?
Usually not. In general, FDA review is necessary when a change or modification could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the medical device. 21 CFR 807.81(a)(3), 814.39.
510(k). For medical devices cleared for market under the 510(k) program, you may refer to our guidance entitled, “Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device.”  That guidance explains that a new 510(k) submission to FDA is necessary for a change or modification to an existing medical device if:
The medical device has a new or changed indication for use (e.g., the diseases or conditions the medical device is intended to treat); or
The proposed change (e.g, modification in design, energy source, chemical composition, or material) could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the medical device.
It is possible, but unlikely, that a software patch will need a new 510(k) submission.3 As with all changes made to devices, you should document the basis of your decisions in the design history file. See 21 CFR 820.3(e), 820.30(j).
“Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device,” Jan. 10, 1997, http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/510kmod.html.
If a submission is necessary, you should refer to “Guidance for FDA Reviewers and Industry, Guidance for the Content of Premarket Submissions for Software Contained in Medical Devices,” May 29, 1998 (see Background section of this guidance).

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
b. Premarket Approval Application (PMA). For medical devices approved under PMAs (21 CFR Part 814), a PMA supplement is required for a software patch if the patch results in a change to the approved indications for use or is deemed by the manufacturer to have an adverse effect on the safety and effectiveness of the approved medical device. 21 CFR 814.39. Otherwise, you should report your decision to apply a software patch to your PMA device to FDA in your annual reports. See 21 CFR 814.39(b), 814.84.
Should I validate the software changes made to address cybersecurity vulnerabilities?
Yes. See answer to Question 4. You should validate all software design changes, including computer software changes to address cybersecurity vulnerabilities, according to an established protocol before approval and issuance. 21 CFR 820.30(i). You may refer to the “General Principles of Software Validation; Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff” (see Background section) for more information about how to validate software changes. For most software changes intended to address cybersecurity vulnerabilities, analysis, inspection, and testing should be adequate and clinical validation should not be necessary.
9.  What else should I do to ensure cybersecurity for networked medical devices?
You should maintain formal business relationships with your OTS software vendors to ensure timely receipt of information concerning quality problems and recommended corrective and preventive actions. Because of the frequency of cybersecurity patches, we recommend that you develop a single cybersecurity maintenance plan to address compliance with the QS regulation and the issues discussed in this guidance document.
While it is customary for the medical device manufacturer to perform these software maintenance activities, there may be situations in which it is appropriate for the user facility, OTS vendor, or a third party to be involved. Your software maintenance plan should provide a mechanism for you to exercise overall responsibility while delegating specific tasks to other parties. The vast majority of healthcare organizations will lack detailed design information and technical resources to assume primary maintenance responsibility for medical device software and, therefore, will rely on you to assume the primary maintenance responsibility.
10. Do I need to report a cybersecurity patch?
Not usually, because most software patches are installed to reduce the risk of developing a problem associated with a cybersecurity vulnerability and not to address a risk to health posed by the device. In most cases, therefore, you would not need to report a cybersecurity patch under 21 CFR Part 806 so long as you have evaluated the change and recorded the correction in your records. However, if the software patch affects the safety or effectiveness of the medical device, you should report the correction to FDA, even if a software maintenance plan is in effect.

1. Introduction
The need for effective cybersecurity to assure medical device functionality and safety has
become more important with the increasing use of wireless, Internet- and network- connected
devices, and the frequent electronic exchange of medical device-related health information.
This guidance has been developed by the FDA to assist industry by identifying issues related
to cybersecurity that manufacturers should consider in the design and development of their
medical devices as well as in preparing premarket submissions for those devices. The
recommendations contained in this guidance document are intended to supplement FDA’s

FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.
2. Scope
This guidance provides recommendations to consider and information to include in FDA medical device premarket submissions for effective cybersecurity management. Effective cybersecurity management is intended to reduce the risk to patients by decreasing the likelihood that device functionality is intentionally or unintentionally compromised by inadequate cybersecurity.
This guidance document is applicable to the following premarket submissions for devices that contain software (including firmware) or programmable logic as well as software that is a medical device:
Premarket Notification (510(k)) including Traditional, Special, and Abbreviated
De novo submissions
Premarket Approval Applications (PMA)
Product Development Protocols (PDP)
Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) submissions.
Definitions
Asset2 - is anything that has value to an individual or an organization.
Authentication - is the act of verifying the identity of a user, process, or device as a prerequisite to allowing access to the device, its data, information, or systems.
Authorization - is the right or a permission that is granted to access a device resource.
Availability – data, information, and information systems are accessible and usable on a timely basis in the expected manner (i.e. the assurance that information will be available when needed).
Confidentiality – data, information, or system structures are accessible only to authorized persons and entities and are processed at authorized times and in the authorized manner,
Manufacturers may also consider applying the cybersecurity principles described in this guidance as appropriate to Investigational Device Exemption submissions and to devices exempt from premarket review.
As defined in ISO/ICE 27032:2012(E) Information technology — Security techniques — Guidelines for cybersecurity.

thereby helping ensure data and system security. Confidentiality provides the assurance that no unauthorized users (i.e. only trusted users) have access to the data, information, or system structures.
Cybersecurity - is the process of preventing unauthorized access, modification, misuse or denial of use, or the unauthorized use of information that is stored, accessed, or transferred from a medical device to an external recipient.
Encryption - is the cryptographic transformation of data into a form that conceals the data’s original meaning to prevent it from being known or used.
Harm- is defined as physical injury or damage to the health of people, or damage to property or the environment.
Integrity – in this document means that data, information and software are accurate and complete and have not been improperly modified.
Life-cycle2 – all phases in the life of a medical device, from initial conception to final decommissioning and disposal.
Malware - is software designed with malicious intent to disrupt normal function, gather sensitive information, and/or access other connected systems.
Privileged User3 - is a user who is authorized (and, therefore, trusted) to perform security-relevant functions that ordinary users are not authorized to perform.
Risk2 – is the combination of the probability of occurrence of harm and the severity of that harm.
Risk Analysis2 – is the systematic use of available information to identify hazards and to estimate the risk.
4. General Principles
Manufacturers should develop a set of cybersecurity controls to assure medical device cybersecurity and maintain medical device functionality and safety.
FDA recognizes that medical device security is a shared responsibility between stakeholders, including health care facilities, patients, providers, and manufacturers of medical devices. Failure to maintain cybersecurity can result in compromised device functionality, loss of data (medical or personal) availability or integrity, or exposure of other connected devices or networks to security threats. This in turn may have the potential to result in patient illness, injury, or death.
As defined in ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971:2007 Medical devices – Application of risk management to medical devices.
3
Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Manufacturers should address cybersecurity during the design and development of the medical device, as this can result in more robust and efficient mitigation of patient risks. Manufacturers should establish design inputs for their device related to cybersecurity, and establish a cybersecurity vulnerability and management approach as part of the software validation and risk analysis that is required by 21 CFR 820.30(g).4 The approach should appropriately address the following elements:
Identification of assets, threats, and vulnerabilities;
Assessment of the impact of threats and vulnerabilities on device functionality and end users/patients;
Assessment of the likelihood of a threat and of a vulnerability being exploited;
Determination of risk levels and suitable mitigation strategies;
Assessment of residual risk and risk acceptance criteria.
Cybersecurity Functions
The Agency recommends that medical device manufacturers consider the following cybersecurity framework core functions to guide their cybersecurity activities: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.5
Identify and Protect
Medical devices capable of connecting (wirelessly or hard-wired) to another device, to the Internet or other network, or to portable media (e.g. USB or CD) are more vulnerable to cybersecurity threats than devices that are not connected. The extent to which security controls are needed will depend on the device’s intended use, the presence and intent of its electronic data interfaces, its intended environment of use, the type of cybersecurity vulnerabilities present, the likelihood the vulnerability will be exploited (either intentionally or unintentionally), and the probable risk of patient harm due to a cybersecurity breach.
Manufacturers should also carefully consider the balance between cybersecurity safeguards and the usability of the device in its intended environment of use (e.g. home use vs. health care facility use) to ensure that the security controls are appropriate for the intended users. For example, security controls should not unreasonably hinder access to a device intended to be used during an emergency situation.
The Agency recommends that medical device manufacturers provide justification in the premarket submission for the security functions chosen for their medical devices.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Examples of security functions to consider for protection of medical devices should include, but should not be limited to, the following:
Limit Access to Trusted Users Only
Limit access to devices through the authentication of users (e.g. user ID and password, smartcard, biometric);
Use automatic timed methods to terminate sessions within the system where appropriate for the use environment;
Where appropriate, employ a layered authorization model by differentiating privileges based on the user role (e.g. caregiver, system administrator) or device role;
Use appropriate authentication (e.g. multi-factor authentication to permit privileged device access to system administrators, service technicians, maintenance personnel);
Strengthen password protection by avoiding “hardcoded” password or common words (i.e. passwords which are the same for each device, difficult to change, and vulnerable to public disclosure) and limit public access to passwords used for privileged device access;
Where appropriate, provide physical locks on devices and their communication ports to minimize tampering;
Require user authentication or other appropriate controls before permitting software or firmware updates, including those affecting the operating system, applications, and anti-malware.
Ensure Trusted Content
Restrict software or firmware updates to authenticated code. One authentication method manufacturers may consider is code signature verification;
Use systematic procedures for authorized users to download version-identifiable software and firmware from the manufacturer;
Ensure capability of secure data transfer to and from the device, and when appropriate, use methods for encryption.
Detect, Respond, Recover
Implement features that allow for security compromises to be detected, recognized, logged, timed, and acted upon during normal use;
Develop and provide information to the end user concerning appropriate actions to take upon detection of a cybersecurity event;
Implement device features that protect critical functionality, even when the device’s cybersecurity has been compromised;
Provide methods for retention and recovery of device configuration by an authenticated privileged user.

Manufacturers may elect to provide an alternative method or approach, with appropriate justification.
6. Cybersecurity Documentation
The type of documentation the Agency recommends you submit in your premarket submission is summarized in this section. These recommendations are predicated on your effective implementation and management of a quality system in accordance with the Quality System Regulation, including Design Controls.
In the premarket submission, manufacturers should provide the following information related to the cybersecurity of their medical device:
Hazard analysis, mitigations, and design considerations pertaining to intentional and unintentional cybersecurity risks associated with your device, including:
A specific list of all cybersecurity risks that were considered in the design of your device;
A specific list and justification for all cybersecurity controls that were established for your device.
A traceability matrix that links your actual cybersecurity controls to the cybersecurity risks that were considered;
A summary describing the plan for providing validated software updates and patches as needed throughout the lifecycle of the medical device to continue to assure its safety and effectiveness. The FDA typically will not need to review or approve medical device software changes made solely to strengthen cybersecurity.
A summary describing controls that are in place to assure that the medical device software will maintain its integrity (e.g. remain free of malware) from the point of origin to the point at which that device leaves the control of the manufacturer; and
Device instructions for use and product specifications related to recommended cybersecurity controls appropriate for the intended use environment (e.g. anti-virus software, use of firewall).

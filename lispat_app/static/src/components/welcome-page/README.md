# Lost in Space and Time
## When Plagiarism is a Good Thing

Sr. Design Project – Medical Device Requirements

Lispat is built to convert documents from their common pdf/docx format to txt,
processes the documents information, performs similarity checks, and builds
a learning model for text classification and prediction all in order to capture
the original information, in a manner that preserves and increases its value,
accessibility and usefulness.

## How to Run

### LOCALLY
##### Requirements

* brew cask install xquartz
* brew install poppler antiword unrtf tesseract swig
* pip install textract

##### NLTK

in terminal run `python`

then run the following to download NLTK.

```
 >>> import nltk`
 >>> nltk.download()
```

nlkt downloader will show up. Download all.

## PDF DECRYPTION

Due to some pdfs having restrictions to their content ```qpdf``` was used in
order to remove these restrictions.

Link: https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf

clone the repo and run.

`pip install -e path/to/lispat`


lispat should be now installed into the OS under your pip env.


You can now run the following commands to both train data and compare submitted
documents:

* NOTE:
* The path must be to a directory containing files of these formats:
- .pdf
- .docx
- .doc
- .txt

`lispat -h`
* help commands

`lispat --path=path/to/docs --convert`
* Coverts any .pdf, .doc, .docx file to .txt format for future analysis
* Files are stored inside /usr/local/var/lispat/<format>\_data/

`lispat --path=path/to/docs --train`
* Upload data of previously submitted documents that are passed by the FDA


`lispat --path=path/todocs --compare`
* upload a submitted document to compare with documents that are already passed by the FDA

Dependencies and package issues are possible with the requirements of the application.
Should use the docker container above all else for easier application use.
